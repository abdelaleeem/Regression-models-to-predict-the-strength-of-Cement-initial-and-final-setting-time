# Regression-models-to-predict-the-strength-of-Cement-initial-and-final-setting-time
this project was an internship project at Lafarge Company for cement production. cement is composed of many compounds and oxides and each compound affect a property in cement like its early and late strength even its color. let's find out how we could solve all these problems.

cement is widely used in various applications and the production process requires taking care of every and each simple detail as it's used in buildings. so the quality control department makes sure that the cement got the optimum quality for using, so that's why they perform many tests on cement that requires time, effort and money.

that's why in this project we are using machine learning to make life easier and save time and money as the tests stay for even 28 days to know its result.

i implemented 4 projects for 4 different tests and they are:
28 days compressive strength : to predict the strength of cement after 28 days in (mega pascal)
 2 days compressive strength : to predict the strength of cement after  2 days in (mega pascal)
initial setting time in minutes
final   setting time in minutes

and at the end of the project we are going to see the accuracies of our models after we tested it on different cement samples.

NOTE: i can't upload the data file as it's private but i can show only a sample of the data to show you the work done and this is to ensure the privacy of the company's data
